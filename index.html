                    <p>My name is Brathikan Vijayamohan Mankayarkarasi, and I currently reside in Edinburgh, United Kingdom. With a robust academic foundation and extensive hands-on experience, I have cultivated a career that seamlessly blends sustainable energy systems, mechanical engineering, and business economics. My journey in these fields has been marked by a commitment to innovation, sustainability, and the pursuit of excellence.</p>

                    <p>My academic path began at the Kumaraguru College of Technology in Tamil Nadu, India, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. Here, I delved into the intricacies of machine theory, fluid power systems, and thermal mechanics, culminating in a project that investigated backflow in natural draft chimneys. This foundational education ignited my passion for engineering and set the stage for further studies.</p>

                    <p>Pursuing my interest in advanced manufacturing and design, I completed a Master’s degree in CAD CAM from the same institution, graduating with distinction. My dissertation focused on harnessing usable energy from the ocean, reflecting my early inclination towards sustainable energy solutions. This phase was instrumental in honing my skills in product lifecycle management, product design, and manufacturing.</p>

                    <p>My quest for knowledge led me to Annamalai University, where I pursued a part-time Master's in Business Economics. This program enriched my understanding of managerial economics, business statistics, and international business, complementing my technical expertise with strong business acumen.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I am undertaking an MSc in Sustainable Energy Systems at the University of Edinburgh. This advanced program allows me to explore energy and environmental economics, power systems engineering, and cutting-edge sustainable technologies. Each course I undertake reinforces my commitment to contributing to a greener, more sustainable future.</p>

                    <p>My professional journey is as diverse as my academic background. At Kinowave in Tamil Nadu, India, I served as an Energy Engineer and Analyst. In this role, I designed components and systems for ocean energy extraction devices, leveraging tools like ANSYS and SolidWorks for simulations. My work in stress analysis, materials selection, and prototyping significantly contributed to projects involving wave energy converters and tidal energy turbines.</p>

                    <p>Following this, I joined the Research Cell at Kumaraguru College of Technology as Lead Innovation and Assistant Professor. Here, I led technology projects from conception to market launch, conducted market research, and secured patents. My role required a blend of leadership, strategic thinking, and technical expertise, fostering an environment of innovation and collaboration.</p>

                    <p>As a Research Associate at the same institution, I led the development of electric vehicle and 3D printer assemblies. My responsibilities included motion simulation, strength analysis, lifecycle analysis, and failure predictions. I also produced technical reports and contributed to the academic community through research and publications.</p>

                    <p>To complement my academic and professional endeavors, I have pursued numerous certifications. These include an MBA Essentials course from the London School of Economics, hands-on machine learning training from the Indian Institute of Science, and mechanical design certifications from Dassault Systems. These certifications have enhanced my skills in financial accounting, competitive strategy, machine learning algorithms, and mechanical design.</p>

                    <p>My technical proficiency spans various tools and software, including ANSYS Mechanical, SolidWorks, MATLAB, Python, Power World, Wamit, Ashes, PVSYST, and OPENLCA. These skills enable me to analyze and develop innovative solutions in the energy, industry, and environmental sectors.</p>

                    <p>I have authored multiple research papers on topics such as energy transition, frictional force analysis, and deep drawing processes, contributing valuable insights to the field. My work has been presented at national and international conferences, reflecting my commitment to advancing knowledge and sharing my findings with the broader community.</p>

                    <p>My efforts have been recognized through several honors and awards, including the prestigious Chevening – TVS Scholarship and victories in competitions such as the IIT Mandi Himalayan Start-up Terk Competition and the Smart India Hackathon. These accolades underscore my dedication to excellence and innovation.</p>

                    <p>Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I am actively involved in volunteer work. As a Local Pathway Fellow with the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network – Youth, I work with a global network of young leaders to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in urban areas. Additionally, as an Ocean Expert with the UNESCO/IOC Project Office, I contribute to initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable ocean practices.</p>

                    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy enhancing my technical skills and staying updated with the latest advancements in my field. My passion for research and teaching drives me to share my knowledge and inspire the next generation of engineers and innovators. With a strong foundation in both technical and business disciplines, I am dedicated to making a positive impact through sustainable and innovative solutions.</p>
