                    <p>Financial inclusion is a critical component of inclusive growth. It is a much-needed intervention for managing financial vulnerabilities, increasing economic resilience by accelerating growth and reducing poverty. Scheduled tribes are the poorest people in India, with 63.68% of Scheduled Tribe households being financially excluded. This study analyses the level of financial inclusion among tribal households in Gondinagar in terms of financial service usage and access, as well as financial awareness.</p>
